Web Optimized FC Webicons Set
=====================

This social icon set is pretty awesome, although there were some aspects that I wanted to change in the library. This fork contains the following changes:

1. Dropped SVG support
2. Segregated the icons into three style sheets (small, normal, large)
3. Turned the PNGs into sprites to lessen HTTP requests (again: small, normal and large sprites)
4. Cleaned CSS, the original was 20k. It's now split into 4kb files

*Usage is the same as before, only now you have to include the CSS files for the sizes you're going to use.*

**Thanks to FairheadCreative for the icons**

FC Webicons Set
=====================

FC Webicons Set is a set of resolution-independent social icons for use on your website. They use feature-detected SVG graphics (with PNG fallbacks) to display the icons over their appropriate negatively indented anchor titles.

If you have icon suggestions, check the issue queue for "Icon Suggestions".

Enjoy FC Webicons!

Web Optimized FC Webicons Set
=====================

FC Webicons Set is a set of resolution-independent social icons for use on your website. They use feature-detected SVG graphics (with PNG fallbacks) to display the icons over their appropriate negatively indented anchor titles.

This social icon set is pretty awesome, although there were some aspects that I wanted to change in the original library. This fork contains the following changes:

1. Dropped SVG support for smaller size and a more simpler approach
2. Segregated the icons into three style sheets (small, normal, large)
3. Turned the PNGs into sprites to lessen HTTP requests (again: small, normal and large sprites)
4. Cleaned CSS, the original was 20k. It's now split into three 4kb files

*Usage is the same as before, only now you have to include the CSS files for the sizes you're going to use.*

**Thanks to [Fairhead Creative](http://fairheadcreative.com) for the icons!**
